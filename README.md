# Cloud-Resume-Challenge---Azure

In the ever-changing world of IT, you need to keep swimming to keep current (Pun intended). Here we will document my progress as I launch into the world of the Cloud

# OverView - What is the Cloud Resume Challenge?
The Cloud Resume Challenge is a project designed to challenge and expose IT professionals to the basics and core services of Cloud computing. This resume created with HTML5 and CSS3 is the first step of many towards completing the Cloud Resume Challenge for Azure. The roadmap for this project will ultimately include working with key Azure services such as:

- Hosting the resume on Azure Static Website via Azure Storage
- Securing my resume using Azure CDN for HTTPS
- Making the website publicly accessible with a domain from Azure DNS
- Creating a database to track website visits using CosmosDB
- Updating the website tracker count with Azure Functions
- Utilizing ARM to run these tasks as IaC

# Where are we now?
Today I wrapped up the resume portion of the project. I'm certainly not a designer but it came together in the end. Good enough, good stuff!

The next step wil be host it in Azure Storage as a Static Website. To be continued!
